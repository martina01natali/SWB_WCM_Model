working on IRRI_WCM_v8_Copy1, following local minima of r_st and Kc0, adding parameters instead of starting simulation from the beginning, 20 runs for each configuration of bounds

## 22.49
run with new bounds for w_max, ww_w, ww_fc, @ 3 sigma

## 12.02
working on v8\_copy1 e \_copy2, 2 parallel simulations with 100 run with respectively large and narrow boundaries

- running simulation on \_v9 with threshold on R of SM @ 0.75: takes forever --> change strategy
- running simulation on \_v9 with threshold on KGE of SM @ 0.75 (too high), @ 0.7 (too high), @ 0.6 (too high, takes forever) --> change strategy
- running simulation on \_v9_Copy1 with new cost function with sum of KGE on sigma0 and SM: takes a standard time
