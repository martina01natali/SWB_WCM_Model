# WORKFLOW

This file is devoted to listing, in chronological order, the processing steps that are necessary to make the whole model to work in a proper way. In particular, the main steps are:

- download input data
- process and clean data in order to have inputs that can be used directly in the codes and are consistent between each other with respect to spatial and temporal resolution, metadata, data type/formatting
- run the model
- optimize the optimizer
- make comparisons with other products
