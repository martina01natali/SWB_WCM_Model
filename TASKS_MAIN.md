To run this code in a significant way, follow:
- 1. check spatial mean: in linear or db scale? --> linear (check Reading_summaries)
    More on spatial distribution of backscattering intensity:
    https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/community/detecting-changes-in-sentinel-1-imagery-pt-1
- 2. check if one-line WCM (single equation, not more) is different from standard
    --> it is, standard performs better but can present wider divergence
- 3. normalize backscattering for acquisition geometry (angle) HOW??? options: cosine, **distribution bias elimination**

# Questions

- how do I normalize SM products from different satellites (always max-min norm?) --> YES
- Is NDVI the best vegetation descriptor to be used in WCM? Using just 1 vegetation descriptor is the best choice or should one use 2 different products in the model?
- Can we use the crop specific parameters in IRRmodel to build a vegetation descriptor and thus eliminate the need for external input? ÔÉ† should look at parameters timeseries (to begin with‚Ä¶)!
- Check if daily aggregation of rain, irrigation (sum) over the whole 24 hours could affect ùúé^0 calibration (we have 30% of total satellite points with rain in the same day and 5% with irrigation)
- Model is VERY UNSTABLE in parameters calibration: why? Optimizer's fault? Few data?
- Is cosine normalization of sigma0 really necessary of better than the statistical approach? Well, it depends. The truth is that backscattering VS angle of incidence over bare soil and vegetated surfaces has different trends: it scales with some power of cosine for rough surfaces, while it is almost flat for vegetated surfaces (Vreugdenhil, 2020). This means that the population of sigma0 values is described differently for different periods, which one may not know a priori. Hence, the best approach when treating surfaces that may be vegetated for some period of time is the statistical approach.
