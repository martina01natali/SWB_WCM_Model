# Thesis' codes
Main repository of scripts for the development of my MSc Thesis. Remote-sensing and soil moisture retrieval related stuff.

In particular, I am developing an integration of a soil water balance model with parametrized irrigation (from Rolle, 2021) and a water cloud model (in the parametrization of Baghdadi, 2017) to retrieve soil moisture from backscattering data from Sentinel-1 SAR. Calibration of the model is performed on backscattering data themselves instead of field soil moisture measurements.
