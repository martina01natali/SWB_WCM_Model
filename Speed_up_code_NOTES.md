# Speeding up code

## Notes from ChatGPT

### Strategies for speeding up code in python

1 - Use C extensions: If you have performance-critical code, you can use C extensions in Python to speed it up. This can be achieved using tools like Cython or Numba.
2 - Optimize algorithms: Algorithmic improvements can be an effective way to speed up your code. Consider using optimized algorithms such as dynamic programming, linear programming, and heuristics to solve your problem more efficiently.
3 - Vectorize code: Vectorizing your code can significantly reduce the running time. This can be achieved by using NumPy or Pandas libraries that offer high-performance arrays and data frames.
4 - Parallelize code: Parallel processing can help you speed up your code. You can use the multiprocessing library in Python to run your code in parallel.
5 - Function length: Shorter functions are easier to debug and maintain. They also make your code more readable. But longer functions can be more efficient in terms of runtime performance. So, the ideal length of a function depends on the specific problem you are solving.
6 - Scripts vs Jupyter Notebooks: Scripts can be easier to automate and run in the background, while Jupyter notebooks are more interactive and better suited for prototyping and exploration. For performance-critical code, it may be best to use scripts and run them in the background.
Overall, the best approach to speeding up your code will depend on the specifics of your problem and the tools and libraries you have at your disposal.

### numba and jit
The `numba` library is a just-in-time (JIT) compiler for Python code that provides high performance for numerical and array-oriented code. The JIT compiler is a feature that allows the code to be compiled just before it is executed, rather than when it is first imported, resulting in improved performance.
To use the numba library, you first need to install it using `pip install numba`. Once installed, you can use the `numba.jit` method to compile a Python function into a faster form that can be executed more efficiently. The `numba.jit` method is a decorator that can be applied to a function to indicate that the function should be compiled.
Here's an example of how to use the numba.jit method:

```python

import numba

@numba.jit
def my_function(x, y):
    return x + y

result = my_function(3, 4)
print(result)
```

In this example, the `my_function` function is decorated with the `numba.jit` method. When this function is called, the JIT compiler compiles the code into a faster form that can be executed more efficiently. The result of the function is then returned and printed to the console.
The numba.jit method has several options that can be used to control the behavior of the JIT compiler. For example, you can specify the target platform (e.g., CPU or GPU) and the type of the input arguments to the function.
It is important to note that not all functions can be optimized using the JIT compiler, and some functions may actually be slower when compiled using the numba.jit method. The numba library is most useful for functions that are computationally intensive, have many loops, and/or use NumPy arrays.
In summary, the numba library and the numba.jit method provide a powerful tool for optimizing Python code for performance. By decorating functions with the numba.jit method, you can take advantage of the JIT compiler to improve the performance of your code.
